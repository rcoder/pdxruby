You signed up to participate in <%= @event.name %>. That event's organizer,
<%= @event.member.email %>, has made changes to the event.

You should double-check the new details, and update your participation status
if necessary:

<%= url_for :controller => 'events',
      :action => 'show',
      :id => @event.id,
      :only_path => false %>
