Dear <%= @member.name %>,

You (or someone who knows your e-mail address) has requested that your
pdx.rb password be reset.  To complete this process, please go to the
following link, enter "<%= @password                 %>" as your
temporary password and then set your password to something more secure.

  <%= url_for :only_path => false, :action => :reset, :id => @member.id %>

If you believe that someone is trying to tamper with your account,
please logout and login with your current password to disable this
temporary security hole.

Happy hacking,

The PDX.rb Crew
