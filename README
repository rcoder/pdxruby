This application was written way back in late 2005 at a group hackfest hosted
by the Portland Ruby Brigade. We wanted a way to propose and RSVP for events
without requiring any particular person or group to manage a calendar for
everyone else.

Anyone can register for an account, propose an event, and sign up to attend
other people's events. There is also some basic support for aggregation of
members' RSS feeds, and feedback from event participants, but the primary use
of the system is still as a simple event calendar.

The file doc/TODO contains a few miscellaneous items we've thought about
changing over the years, but overall this whole codebase is probably of more
interest as a historical oddity than as a useful application for other people
to use. It uses a mish-mash of APIs, coding styles, and tests contributed by
about a dozen different maintainers over the last three years, and certainly
shows its age when compared to a shiny new legacy-free Rails 2 application.
