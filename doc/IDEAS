== pdxruby.org ideas ==

Notes:

1) If you're interested in implementing one of these ideas, send an
   email to the -dev mailing list to make sure it fits in with the
   current direction of the site.

2) Once you start work on a task, please move it to the TODO file
   and put your name in [square brackets] at the end of the item.

_Community Stuff_
  - del.icio.us aggregator.  Let members share their del username
    and fetch certain tags
  
  - provide an rss feed of our aggregated/combined feed data

  - provide an rss feed of events, and maybe an rss feed for
    the participations for an event

  - poll for event location (suggested by bleything on the dev list)

  - It would be nice if the feeds could be moderated by people. If one
    person posts a bunch of off-topic entries, then the last 5 isn't very
    Ruby-based. Currently, a user can delete his or her own articles, which is probably
    good-enough for a little while.
        - Perhaps a field should be added to the articles relation
          that contains the number of 'nay' votes. When some threshold
          is reached, the article is not shown (but not deleted - if
          it were, the feeder would just grab it again next run)

_UI Stuff_

  - "calender view" for events, perhaps week-at-a-time too
