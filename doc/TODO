Notes:

1) If you complete one of these, please remove it from the list. 

2) If you want to "claim" a task (i.e. you plan on doing it shortly), 
   put your name in [square brackets] at the end of the event.

_Spamming_
  
  - All members are notified of new events

  - Event organizer isn't notified when they sign up for the event

_Other_

  - Agenda should be editable by any (status: yes) participant

  - User should be able to delete their own account...

  - Validation for Article, plus tests to match.

  - Some pseudo-relationships implemented using map can be done with
    has_many :through instead.

_Infrastructure_

  - Switch to acts_as_authenticated for authentication

_Cosmetic_

  - Upcoming events should be ordered ASC (i.e. more soon things on top)

  - Make timestamps prettier (this and following 2 items 
    suggested by bleything on dev-list)

  - Article list enhancements (sort by author, etc.)

_Testing_
  
  - write functional tests for application.rb
  - write functional tests for articles_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for events_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for feedbacks_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for locations_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for participants_controller.rb
