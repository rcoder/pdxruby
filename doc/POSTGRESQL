How about a disposable database for your development environment?

Here's the quickstart.  Only assumption is the path for postgres
binaries and that you have xterm.  Oh, and write access to /tmp/.  That
should do it.

Except for config/database.yml.  Hmm.  That's tricky.  Ok, let's say if
you don't have one, that you need one.  How's that?

So, just copy and paste all of this into your shell.  If you like it,
let's put it all in a script.

# for testing:

  rm /tmp/pdxruby_test -rf
  svk co //local/pdxruby/trunk /tmp/pdxruby_test
  cd /tmp/pdxruby_test

# (you may have to adjust the $PATH to taste)

  test -e config/database.yml || cp config/database.yml.quickstart config/database.yml

# you may need to add a dummy user and password to database.yml

  which postmaster || PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/postgresql/bin
  export PGDATA=local_db
  export PGHOST=/tmp/pdxruby_socket
  mkdir -p $PGHOST
  initdb -D $PGDATA
  xterm -e postmaster -D $PGDATA -k $PGHOST &
  while ( ! psql -l ); do sleep 1;echo "hi";done
  createdb pdxruby_test
  createdb pdxruby_dev
  rake migrate
  xterm -e 'script/server' &



# later...

  which postmaster || PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/postgresql/bin
  export PGDATA=local_db
  export PGHOST=/tmp/pdxruby_socket
  mkdir -p $PGHOST
  xterm -e postmaster -D $PGDATA -k $PGHOST &
  while ( ! psql -l ); do sleep 1;echo "hi";done
  xterm -e 'script/server' &


(aside:  wish I could use something not in /tmp/, but it has to be an
absolute path and statically spelled-out in database.yml, so no $PWD.
sorry.)

Then your database.yml would be roughly:

  login: &login
    adapter: postgresql
    host: /tmp/pdxruby_socket
    user: yourusername
    password: itdoesntmatter
  
  development:
    database: pdxruby_dev
    <<: *login
  
  test:
    database: pdxruby_test
    <<: *login
  
  production:
    database: pdxruby_production
    <<: *login
